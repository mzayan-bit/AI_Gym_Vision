# The 'path', 'roboflow', 'test', 'train', 'val' sections are primarily
# for training and dataset organization within a YOLO project.
# They are not strictly needed for inference if you are loading the model
# and its class names directly from the .pt file and this YAML.
# However, keeping them doesn't hurt.
